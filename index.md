## About me
I received a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the [University of Colorado at Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) in 2003 and then spent the next four years as a National Science Foundation (NSF) Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Utah](https://www.math.utah.edu/) before joining the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.boisestate.edu/math/) at Boise State. I have also worked as a software engineer in industry, and held visiting research positions at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/) and the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford. I currently serve as the treasurer of the [SIAM Pacific Northwest (PNW) section](https://sites.google.com/site/siampnwsection/home).<br>

## Research
My research interests are in computational and applied mathematics, with a specific focus on the following
* Approximation theory and practice
* Meshfree methods using radial basis function (RBF) methods
* Spectral and high-order finite difference methods
* Numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) on surfaces
* Coupled bulk-surface biomechanical problems
* Geophysical fluid dynamics, especially arising spherical and elliptical domains
* Iterative methods for linear systems
* Scientific computing
* Numerical software development

## Teaching
I very much enjoy teaching and have had the opportunity to instruct a range of mathematics courses from the undergraduate to the graduate level.  These courses inlcude calculus, ordinary/partial differential equations, linear algebra, computational mathematics, complex variables, applied math, approximation theory, numerical analysis, numerical linear algebra, numerical differential equations, and matrix methods in data science.  I have also led workshops and tutorials on radial basis function methods.
