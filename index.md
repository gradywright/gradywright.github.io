## About me
I received his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the [University of Colorado at Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) in 2003. I then spent the next four years as a National Science Foundation (NSF) Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Utah](https://www.math.utah.edu/) before joining the Department of Mathematics at Boise State. I have also held visiting research positions at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/) and the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford. Currently, I am the treasurer of the [SIAM Pacific Northwest (PNW) section](https://sites.google.com/site/siampnwsection/home).<br>

## Research
My research interests are in computational and applied mathematics, with a specific focus on the following
* Approximation theory and practice
* Meshfree methods using radial basis function (RBF) methods
* Spectral and high-order finite difference methods
* Numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) on surfaces
* Coupled bulk-surface biomechanical problems
* Geophysical fluid dynamics, especially arising spherical and elliptical domains
* Iterative methods for linear systems
* Numerical software development
