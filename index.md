## About me
I received a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the [University of Colorado at Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) in 2003 and then spent the next four years as a National Science Foundation (NSF) Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Utah](https://www.math.utah.edu/) before joining the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.boisestate.edu/math/) at Boise State. I have worked as a software engineer in industry and held visiting research positions at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/), [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, and [Division of Scientific Computing](https://www.it.uu.se/research/scicomp) at Uppsala University. I have previously served as President and Treasurer of the [SIAM Pacific Northwest (PNW) section](https://sites.google.com/site/siampnwsection/home), and am currently the Co-Director of the [Computing PhD Program](https://www.boisestate.edu/computing/) at Boise State.<br>

## Research
My research focuses on computational mathematics and scientific computing, with an emphasis on developing, analyzing, and implementing novel numerical methods to model and simulate complex phenomena arising in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines.  My interest span multiple areas, including 
* kernel approximation 
* meshless/meshfree methods for PDEs 
* PDEs on the sphere and more general surfaces
* spectral and high-order finite difference methods
* multilevel solvers/preconditioners
* the immersed boundary method
* rational approximation   

I have also engaged in a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary domains, such as 
* biological fluids
* climate modeling and numerical weather prediction
* geodynamics
* computer graphics
* cosmology

## Teaching
I enjoy teaching and have had the opportunity to instruct a range of mathematics courses from the undergraduate to the graduate level.  These courses inlcude calculus, ordinary/partial differential equations, linear algebra, computational mathematics, complex variables, applied math, approximation theory, numerical analysis, numerical linear algebra, numerical differential equations, and matrix methods in data science.  I have also instructed workshops and tutorials on radial basis function methods.
